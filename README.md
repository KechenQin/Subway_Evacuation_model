# Subway_Evacuation_model

This is my graduation thesis. I collaborated with my friend Daoyuan Jia to design a metro evacuation model in fire accident.

We combined graph generation algorithm, pathfinding algorithm and many physical laws to build the model. 

We used Jbox2d and Unity3d to implement 2d and 3d models.

This file consists of main java code of 2d model and a video of 3d model.

I also attach a paper about this research.
